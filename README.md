After going through your question, what I understand is that you want to add a controller class in the project that you just unzipped. Right?

For that do the following.

Unzip the project again.
Open in Eclipse
Run maven build command to resolve the dependencies. (It's ok if it failed for now).
Right click on demo/src/main/java and go to new->Other. select class and then next. write the name of the controller class and then finish.
